Google API Testing using LoadRunner - a sample script for tutorials

This repo holds a sample starter script used as the basis for making changes during tutorials I conduct at StarWest / StarEast and on-line. 

I'd be glad to talk about it. wilsonmar@gmail.com or 310.320-7878.

Note the .gitignore file is constructed to include all files for training purposes even though in production some files are not uploaded to a repository.
